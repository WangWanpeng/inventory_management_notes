\subsection{Base Stock Model}


\subsubsection{Common notation}
\label{sec:common-notation}

Let $I_t$ denote the on-hand inventory at time $t$, $B_t$ the number
of backorders, $R_t$ the number of out-standing replenishments, and
$X_t := X(t-L,t]$ the demand that occurred during the time interval
$(t-L, t]$. Note that here we write $X_t$ to represent the
random variable $X$ of Factory Physics.
We also write
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:16}
   G(r) = \P{X_t\leq r},
\end{equation}
and for the average demand during a lead time 
\begin{equation*}
\theta = \E{X_t}.
\end{equation*}

Under the basestock policy the above random variables $I_t, B_t, R_t$
and $X_t$ satisfy a number of important relations.  Recally that
according to the basestock policy we issue a replenishment order as
soon as the re-order level $r$ is hit. First, as for each demand a
replenishment order is sent, it must be that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:8}
   R_t = X(t-L, t] = X_t,
\end{equation}
that is, the number of outstanding replenishments at time $t$ equals
all demand $X_t$ that occurred during the previous leadtime.  
Second, as each demand spawns a replenishment, it must be for all time
$t$ that the on-hand inventory $I_t$ plus the number of
replenishments $R_t$ minus all backorders $B_t$ remains
constant. That is, 
\begin{equation*}
I_t + R_t - B_t = \text{ constant}.
\end{equation*}
Third, we do not backorder demand when there is on-hand stock and we
also match backorders (if any) with replenishments as they arrive, it
must hold that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:9}
   I_t B_t =0, \text{ for all }  t\geq 0.
\end{equation}
In other words, at any moment in time the on-hand inventory $I_t = 0$ or the
number of backorders $B_t=0$.

Assuming that at time $t=0$,
there are no outstanding replenishments and no backorders, we can
safely assume that $I_0 = r+1$. The above then implies that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:7}
   I_t + R_t - B_t = r+1, \text{ for all }  t\geq 0.
\end{equation}


When dealing with positive leadtimes two concepts are very useful. The \emph{inventory level} $\IL_t$ at time $t$ is the basestock level minus the demand: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:23}
  \IL_t = r+1 - X_t
\end{equation}
Note that from~\eqref{eq:8} and~\eqref{eq:7} it follows that
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{split}
  \IL_t 
&=r - X_t \\
&= (I_t + R_t - B_t) - X_t \\
&= I_t - B_t.
  \end{split}
\end{equation*}


The \emph{inventory position} $\IP_t$ is the inventory level plus all outstanding replenishments:
\begin{equation*}
  \IP_t = \IL_t + R_t.
\end{equation*}
From \eqref{eq:7} we conclude that 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:20}
\IP_t =\IL_t + R_t = I_t - B_t +R_t = r+1.
\end{equation}
Thus, for the basestock mode in continuous time, the inventory position is constant. 


\begin{question}
  What is the reorder level $r$ for a make-to-order inventory system?
\end{question}
\begin{solution}
  In a make-to-order setting, there is no on-hand
  inventory. Production starts when a job comes in. Thus, if we take
  $r=-1$, then when the inventory position hits $-1$, we issue a
  production order. Clearly, $I_t=0$ always, and $B_t$ is the number
  of jobs waiting to get served by production.
\end{solution}


\subsubsection{Computing the Service level}

The service level $S(r)$ is defined as the fraction of demand that
perceives, on arrival, a positive stock level. As we assume that demand
occurs in single units, this fraction is therefore equal to the fraction
of demand served from on-hand stock. We also assume that the arrival
process is given by a Poisson process. Therefore, by the PASTA property,
the fraction of demand served from stock is equal to the (long-run)
fraction of time that the inventory level is positive. Hence,
\begin{equation*}
   S(r) = \P{I_t >0}.
\end{equation*}

Using that $I_t>0$ at time $t$ implies that $B_t = 0$,
it follows from Eq.~\eqref{eq:7} that:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:10}
  \begin{split}
   S(r) &= \P{I_t >0} \\
   &= \P{r+1 + B_t - R_t >0}, \text{  from  \eqref{eq:7}}  \\
   &= \P{r+1 - R_t >0}, \text{ as } B_t = 0, \\
   &= \P{R_t < r+1} \\
   &= \P{R_t \leq r} \\
   & = \P{X_t \leq  r}, \text{from  \eqref{eq:8}}, \\
   &= G(r),  \text{ from \eqref{eq:16}} \\
   &=  \sum_{i=0}^{r} g_i.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:13}
   S(r) = G(r) = \sum_{i=0}^r \P{X_t = i},
\end{equation}
and \emph{not} $G(r+1)$ as in the third edition of Factory Physics.

\subsubsection{Computing the average backorder level}


When does a backorder occur? This happens whenever
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:11}
  \begin{split}
   \{B_t > 0\} 
&= \{R_t - r-1>0\}, \quad \text{ as } R_t - B_t = r+1\text{ when } B_t >0, \\
&= \{X_t - r-1>0\},\quad \text{ since  } R_t  = X_t.
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Hence,
\begin{equation*}
   \begin{split}
     B(r) 
   &= \E{B_t} \\
   &= \E{\max\{B_t, 0\}} \\
   &= \E{\max\{R_t - r - 1, 0\}} \\
   &= \E{\max\{X_t - r - 1, 0\}} \\
   &= \sum_{i=r+1}^\infty (i- r -1)\P{X_t = i}\\
   &= \sum_{i=r+1}^\infty (i- r -1)g_i \\
   &= \sum_{i=r+2}^\infty (i- r -1)g_i,
     \end{split}
\end{equation*}
where the last equation follows from the fact that when $i=r+1$,
$i-r-1 =0$. I find the following easier to memorize, hence I use this
in the sequel:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:12}
   B(r)  = \sum_{i=r+1}^\infty (i- r -1)g_i.
\end{equation}

Note that in the above formula for $B(r)$ the summation runs to $\infty$, which is a bit problematic for numerical purposes. In the proof below we show that this expression can be rewritten to 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:17}
   B(r) 
%= \sum_{i=r+1}^{\infty} \bar G(i)
   = \theta - \sum_{j=0}^{r} \bar G(j)
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:18}
   \bar G(i) = \P{X>i} = 1 - \P{X\leq i} = 1 - G(i),
\end{equation}
and $\theta = \E{X_t}$. You can skip the proof. 
\begin{proof}
Define first the function
\begin{equation*}
   \1{i< j} =
     \begin{cases}
       1, &\text{  if } i < j, \\
   0, &\text{ else},
     \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
so that we can write
\begin{equation*}
  \sum_{j=0}^\infty \1{j< i-r - 1} = i-r -1.
\end{equation*}
Now, using \eqref{eq:12},
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:19}
  \begin{split}
       B(r) &= 
   \sum_{i=r+1}^\infty (i-r-1) g(i)   \\
   &= \sum_{i=r+1}^\infty\sum_{j=0}^\infty \1{j < i-r-1}\, g(i)   = 
    \sum_{j=0}^\infty \sum_{i=r+1}^\infty \1{i > j +r + 1}\, g(i)\\
   &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty \sum_{i=j + r+2}^\infty  g(i) = 
   \sum_{j=0}^\infty \P{X_t \geq j + r+2}  \\
   &=\sum_{j=0}^\infty \P{X_t > j + r+1} \\
   &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty \bar G(j+r+1) =\sum_{j=r+1}^\infty  \bar G(j).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Finally, this can be simplied a bit by using that
$\sum_{i=0}^\infty \bar G(i) = \theta$:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:119}
  \begin{split}
   B(r) 
   &= \sum_{j=r+1}^\infty  \bar G(j) \\
   &= \sum_{j=0}^\infty  \bar G(j) - \sum_{j=0}^{r} \bar G(j)\\
   &= \theta - \sum_{j=0}^{r} \bar G(j)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
  
\end{proof}
	   

\subsubsection{Computing the expected on-hand inventory}

Taking expectations at the left and right hand side of \eqref{eq:7} we get
\begin{equation*}
  \E{I_t + R_t - B_t} = r+1,
\end{equation*}
from which we find for the on-hand inventory $I_t$: 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:6}
  \begin{split}
  \E{I_t}
  &= r+1 - \E{R_t} + \E{B_t}  \\
  & = r + 1 - \E{X_t} + B(r) \\
  & = r + 1 - \theta + B(r) \\
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Simulation of the basestock inventory model}
\label{sec:simul-basest-invent}

Consider a periodic-time model so that $\IP_t$ is the inventory position at the end of period $t$. Write $D_t = X(t-1, t]$ for the demand that occured in period $t$. (Recall that $X_t = X(t-L, t]$ is the demand during the leadtime $L$, which is not the same as the demand during one period.)
 Then the sequence $\{\IP_i\}$ must satisfy the recursion:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:15}
  \IP_t = r+1 = r+1 - D_t + D_t \1{D_t>0}.
\end{equation}
To see this, observe that under the basestock policy the inventory
position is always kept at level $r+1$, c.f., \eqref{eq:20}. Thus, if
the inventory position $\IP_t$ at the end of period $t$ minus the demand
$D_i$ during period $i$ is less than $r+1$, we need to reorder the
shortage. Since the shortage is precisely the demand during period
$t$, i.e., $D_t$, we order $D_t$. (Recall that $\1{D_t>0} = 1$ if
$D_i>0$ and is $0$ otherwise.)

When the leadtime $L$ is one period or more, the replenishments do not arrive right away but $L$ periods later. The consequences of the inventory level are that
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:21}
  \IL_t = \IL_{t-1} - D_t + D_{t-L}\1{D_{t-L}>0}.
\end{equation}
Thus, what we ordered $L$ periods `ago', we receive `now'.

Once we carry out a simulation for $n$ periods, we can estimate the
performance measure. The average  inventory on-hand is
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:22}
  I = \frac 1n \sum_{t=1}^n \IL_t\1{\IL_t \geq 0} = \frac1n\sum_{t=1}^n \max{\IL_t, 0}
\end{equation}
the average backlog  is
\begin{equation}
  B = - \frac 1n \sum_{t=1}^n \IL_t\1{\IL_t < 0} = \frac1n\sum_{t=1}^n \max{-\IL_t, 0}
\end{equation}
because $\IL_t<0$ if there are backorders, recall~\eqref{eq:23}. 
The service level is 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:22}
  S = \frac 1n \sum_{i=t}^n \1{\IL_t \geq 0},
\end{equation}
